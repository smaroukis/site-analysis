Full_Sensitivity_Analysis.ipynb is a compilation of python code that takes in a user created matrix and permutes each element in the matrix with a normal distribution centered around the element with a standard deviation of 1. This procedure was used in a sensitivity analysis for the Racer-Trust Solar Farm Design Project at the University of Michigan where my team was tasked with evaluating the viability of installing solar farms on landfills.

Specifically, the raw site data is the result of a semester of research and conversations with industry exports from utilities, solar developers, and policy analysts. After determing the scoring for each criteria for each site on a scale of 1-10, we used a weighting function for each criteria applied to each site, giving the sites a total score from 1-10. Then we ranked the sites from 1-20. 

The sensitivity analysis was used to introduce randomness into our matrix, to both check how our sites held up to changes in policy and other criteria, and also to validate our decision matrix and site choice. 

A final presentation will be added in December 2016.
